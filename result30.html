As it did with the ex-Playmate, the Enquirer signed the ex-doorman to a contract that effectively prevented him from going public with a juicy tale that might hurt Trump's campaign for president.","WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Some say it's a fight between West and South. Or a battle for President Donald Trump's affections. Or a test of who can woo conservatives. But one thing is clear: If the showdown between California Rep. Kevin McCarthy and Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise for House speaker is a popularity contest, it will be tight. \"Steve is the more low-key guy, Kevin is more the big handshake, but they're equally popular,\" said Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y. \"It's not like right versus left or a good guy versus a bad guy.\"","BEIJING (AP) \u2014 China's government on Thursday denied President Xi Jinping's promise of market-opening measures this week was aimed at settling a tariff dispute with Washington and said negotiations are impossible under \"unilateral coercion\" by the United States. A commerce ministry spokesman, Gao Feng, complained U.S. President Donald Trump's government has \"shown no sincerity,\" according to the official Xinhua News Agency. Gao said the two sides have yet to start negotiations.","MOSCOW (AP) \u2014 When the U.S. fired Tomahawk missiles at a Syrian airfield a year ago after a chemical weapons attack, the Pentagon gave Moscow advance warning to get its personnel out of harm's way. Since then, U.S.-Russian relations have soured, and the two nuclear powers have raised the ante, getting dangerously close to a potential military clash in Syria. U.S. President Donald Trump has taunted Moscow to \"get ready\" for \"nice and new and 'smart'\" missiles coming to punish Syria for a purported chemical attack on Saturday that killed at least 40 people. The tweet followed Russia's warning that it will strike at incoming U.S. missiles and their launch platforms.","WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Russia collusion probe. The Stormy Daniels allegations. The escalating tension with Moscow. The tempests that have separately buffeted the White House for months merged into a maelstrom this week and threatened to engulf President Donald Trump, who on Wednesday railed against members of the Justice Department by name and took to Twitter to threaten military strikes in Syria and taunt a nuclear-armed power.","SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 California Gov. Jerry Brown accepted President Donald Trump's call to send the National Guard to the Mexican border, but rejected the White House's portrait of a burgeoning border crisis and insisted that his troops will have nothing to do with immigration enforcement. The Democratic governor broke a week of silence Wednesday by agreeing to contribute 400 troops, though not all will be on the border. Brown's commitment brought pledges from the four states that border Mexico just shy of the low end of the president's target to marshal 2,000 to 4,000 troops.","JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) \u2014 Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens calls it an \"entirely consensual relationship.\" But the woman with whom he has acknowledged having an affair says Greitens spanked, slapped, grabbed and shoved her during a series of sexual encounters that at times left her crying and afraid. The woman's graphic testimony was revealed in a report released Wednesday by a special Missouri legislative committee that now is expanding its mission to recommend whether lawmakers should begin impeachment proceedings to try to remove the Republican governor from office.","BOSTON (AP) \u2014 Five years after two brothers who had been living in America for about a decade bombed the Boston Marathon, federally funded community programs to prevent attacks by homegrown extremists are barely underway and face an uncertain future. These projects, which grew out of a strategy developed during the Obama administration, are aimed at steering young people away from extremism. But they have been hobbled almost from the start by suspicion and mistrust among Muslims, who complain they are being singled out. And it's unclear whether the strategy will continue to be funded under the Trump administration.","WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged that regulation of social media companies is \"inevitable\" and disclosed that his own personal information has been compromised by malicious outsiders. But after two days of congressional testimony, what seemed clear was how little Congress seems to know about Facebook, much less what to do about it. House lawmakers aggressively questioned Zuckerberg Wednesday on user data, privacy settings and whether the company is biased against conservatives. As they did in the Senate a day earlier, both Republicans and Democrats suggested that regulation might be needed, but there was no consensus and few specifics about what that might look like \u2014 or even what the biggest problems are.","WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Trump administration is considering a plan that would allow states to require certain food stamp recipients to undergo drug testing, handing a win to conservatives who've long sought ways to curb the safety net program. The proposal under review would be narrowly targeted, applying mostly to people who are able-bodied, without dependents and applying for some specialized jobs, according to an administration official briefed on the plan. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said roughly 5 percent of participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program could be affected.","Cristiano Ronaldo's injury-time penalty put holders Real Madrid through to the Champions League semi-finals after a stunning Juventus comeback.","Prosecutors reveal Belgian cyclist Michael Goolaerts, who died aged 23 on Sunday, suffered cardiac arrest, causing his crash at Paris-Roubaix.","Congressional Republicans moved to head off any attempt by President Donald Trump to fire special counsel Robert Mueller as the president continued to attack the Russia investigation and the Justice Department.","Consumer-safety advocates and autonomous-vehicle experts criticized Tesla Inc. for issuing another statement about the death of a customer that pinned the blame on driver inattentiveness.","President Donald Trump is still weighing options for U.S. military action against Syria as Western powers rallied against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad over an apparent chemical weapons attack near Damascus.","President Donald Trump discussed firing Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein with aides at the White House on Wednesday, a person familiar with the matter said, as a chorus of Trump\u2019s allies and advisers urge him to thwart the investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 election.","When Apple Inc.\u2019s HomePod smart speaker went on sale in January, it entered a market pioneered and dominated by Amazon\u2019s Echo lineup of Alexa-powered devices.

As it did with the ex-Playmate, the Enquirer signed the ex-doorman to a contract that effectively prevented him from going public with a juicy tale that might hurt Trump's campaign for president.","WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Some say it's a fight between West and South. Or a battle for President Donald Trump's affections. Or a test of who can woo conservatives. But one thing is clear: If the showdown between California Rep. Kevin McCarthy and Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise for House speaker is a popularity contest, it will be tight. \"Steve is the more low-key guy, Kevin is more the big handshake, but they're equally popular,\" said Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y. \"It's not like right versus left or a good guy versus a bad guy.\"","BEIJING (AP) \u2014 China's government on Thursday denied President Xi Jinping's promise of market-opening measures this week was aimed at settling a tariff dispute with Washington and said negotiations are impossible under \"unilateral coercion\" by the United States. A commerce ministry spokesman, Gao Feng, complained U.S. President Donald Trump's government has \"shown no sincerity,\" according to the official Xinhua News Agency. Gao said the two sides have yet to start negotiations.","MOSCOW (AP) \u2014 When the U.S. fired Tomahawk missiles at a Syrian airfield a year ago after a chemical weapons attack, the Pentagon gave Moscow advance warning to get its personnel out of harm's way. Since then, U.S.-Russian relations have soured, and the two nuclear powers have raised the ante, getting dangerously close to a potential military clash in Syria. U.S. President Donald Trump has taunted Moscow to \"get ready\" for \"nice and new and 'smart'\" missiles coming to punish Syria for a purported chemical attack on Saturday that killed at least 40 people. The tweet followed Russia's warning that it will strike at incoming U.S. missiles and their launch platforms.","WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Russia collusion probe. The Stormy Daniels allegations. The escalating tension with Moscow. The tempests that have separately buffeted the White House for months merged into a maelstrom this week and threatened to engulf President Donald Trump, who on Wednesday railed against members of the Justice Department by name and took to Twitter to threaten military strikes in Syria and taunt a nuclear-armed power.","SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 California Gov. Jerry Brown accepted President Donald Trump's call to send the National Guard to the Mexican border, but rejected the White House's portrait of a burgeoning border crisis and insisted that his troops will have nothing to do with immigration enforcement. The Democratic governor broke a week of silence Wednesday by agreeing to contribute 400 troops, though not all will be on the border. Brown's commitment brought pledges from the four states that border Mexico just shy of the low end of the president's target to marshal 2,000 to 4,000 troops.","JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) \u2014 Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens calls it an \"entirely consensual relationship.\" But the woman with whom he has acknowledged having an affair says Greitens spanked, slapped, grabbed and shoved her during a series of sexual encounters that at times left her crying and afraid. The woman's graphic testimony was revealed in a report released Wednesday by a special Missouri legislative committee that now is expanding its mission to recommend whether lawmakers should begin impeachment proceedings to try to remove the Republican governor from office.","BOSTON (AP) \u2014 Five years after two brothers who had been living in America for about a decade bombed the Boston Marathon, federally funded community programs to prevent attacks by homegrown extremists are barely underway and face an uncertain future. These projects, which grew out of a strategy developed during the Obama administration, are aimed at steering young people away from extremism. But they have been hobbled almost from the start by suspicion and mistrust among Muslims, who complain they are being singled out. And it's unclear whether the strategy will continue to be funded under the Trump administration.","WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged that regulation of social media companies is \"inevitable\" and disclosed that his own personal information has been compromised by malicious outsiders. But after two days of congressional testimony, what seemed clear was how little Congress seems to know about Facebook, much less what to do about it. House lawmakers aggressively questioned Zuckerberg Wednesday on user data, privacy settings and whether the company is biased against conservatives. As they did in the Senate a day earlier, both Republicans and Democrats suggested that regulation might be needed, but there was no consensus and few specifics about what that might look like \u2014 or even what the biggest problems are.","WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Trump administration is considering a plan that would allow states to require certain food stamp recipients to undergo drug testing, handing a win to conservatives who've long sought ways to curb the safety net program. The proposal under review would be narrowly targeted, applying mostly to people who are able-bodied, without dependents and applying for some specialized jobs, according to an administration official briefed on the plan.
